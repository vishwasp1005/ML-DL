 📌 DAY 5 — Naive Bayes + SVM (Theory Only)

### ✔ Naive Bayes
- Based on Bayes theorem
- Types: Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli
- Used in spam detection, text classification
- Very fast and works well with small datasets
- Code implementation added

### ✔ SVM (Theory)
- Maximum margin classifier
- Uses hyperplane + support vectors
- Works well with small, high-dimensional datasets
- Kernel trick: Polynomial, RBF
- Scaling required
